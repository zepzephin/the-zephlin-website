  <h3 class="allign title">Website launch! | 14/03/25</h3>
  <h5 class="allign content">
    Actually finally launched the webite after sitting on the domain for moths lol <br>
    I'll try to figure stuff out, domain was bough with spaceship and their hosting :/ (idk how good that is lol) <br>
    anyway im going to stick with it while its up <br>
    this is written right into the HTML btw, I think it would be usefull to try and find a way to import docs for this, its not the most convenient. <p>
    As for my plans for this, idk. I think i want to try and blog GD stuff, nobody i think is doing much of that and for me its kinda easy to write what im feeling about things. <br>
    I'll also use it just for personal stuff like showing off my sewing stuff :p  <br>
    I will also try and update in a blog the changes I'm making to the website underneath it, to start that off I figured out how to redirect, currently trying to find out how to rewrite URLS but its a lot more challenging with the tools I've got <p>
    Ty for visiting while its still in very early stages. Feel free to follow me on my socials for updates!
